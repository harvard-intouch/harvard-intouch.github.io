## Who we are

We are SEAS graduate students, each experiencing the highs and lows of graduate school, and looking to create a supportive and welcoming community for our peers and for ourselves. 

## Our mission

Our mission is to create a student culture at SEAS that prioritizes student well-being. We address the imposter phenomenon, stress, isolation that students commonly experience over the course of their program. We do this by promoting open and honest communication about:
* Work/life balance
* Mental health, imposter phenomenon and isolation
* Managing advising and collaborator relationships
* Bullying and harassment
* Navigating program requirements (e.g. what is a manageable G1 course load?)
* Navigating personal conflicts with friends, significant others, etc.


## What we do

**Biweekly Coffee Chat:** A safe space (with free food and coffee) for graduate students across SEAS to develop a broader sense of community, share in the highs and the lows, and to ask for advice from InTouch peers and/or fellow students. 

**One-on-one chats:** We meet with anyone who wants to discuss a specific or personal topic in detail. Our conversations are always private and discrete. 


There are certain issues we are **not** trained to help with; for example,
* We cannot provide a medical perspective or psychotherapy
* We cannot provide mental health counseling
* However, we can talk through issues and connect you with additional resources.

Our **obligation** is to keep all chats are **private and discreet**. That is, we will not share any details of our conversations with faculty or administrative staff unless you request otherwise. There are a **few exceptions**:
* Our faculty advisor will be notified of extenuating circumstances if we perceive threat of harm to self or others.
* Issues of sexual harrasment must be reported, as required by Title IX.
