## Who we are

We are SEAS graduate students, each experiencing the highs and lows of graduate school, and looking to create a supportive and welcoming community for our peers and for ourselves. 

## Our mission

Our mission is to create a student culture at SEAS that prioritizes student well-being. We address the imposter phenomenon, stress, isolation that students commonly experience over the course of their program. We do this by promoting open and honest communication about:
* Work/life balance
* Mental health, imposter phenomenon and isolation
* Managing advising and collaborator relationships
* Bullying and harassment
* Navigating program requirements (e.g. what is a manageable G1 course load?)
* Navigating personal conflicts with friends, significant others, etc.


## What we do

**Biweekly Coffee Chat:** A safe space (with free food and coffee) for graduate students across SEAS to develop a broader sense of community, share in the highs and the lows, and to ask for advice from InTouch peers and/or fellow students. 

**One-on-one chats:** We meet with anyone who wants to discuss a specific or personal topic in detail. Our conversations are always private and discrete.
