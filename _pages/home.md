We are here to help navigate the journey through graduate school and to build community between SEAS graduate students.
We are trained to listen, brainstorm, and direct you to helpful resources within and outside Harvard.

Examples of frequently encountered obstacles:
* Academics, advisor relationships, research, etc.
* Personal conflicts with friends, significant others, etc.
* Maintaining balance, mental health, and general well-being
