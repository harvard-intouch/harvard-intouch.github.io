We are here to help navigate the journey through graduate school.
Our number one goal is to build community between SEAS students.
We are trained to listen, brainstorm, and direct you to helpful resources within and outside Harvard.

Examples of Frequently Encountered Obstacles:
* Academics, advisor relationships, research, etc.
* Personal conflicts with friends, significant others, etc.
* Maintaining balance, mental health, and general well-being

There are certain issues we are not trained to help with; for example,
* We cannot provide a medical perspective or psychotherapy
* We cannot provide mental health counseling

However, we **can** talk through issues and connect you with additional resources.

Our obligations to keep things **anonymous** and **confidential** are:
* All chats are private and discreet. We will not share any details of our conversations with faculty or administrative staff unless you request otherwise. There are a few exceptions:
* Our faculty advisor will be notified of extenuating circumstances if we perceive threat of harm to self or others.
* Issues of sexual harrasment must be reported, as required by Title IX.
