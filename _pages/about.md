We are Harvard's Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab, led by [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/). We use probabilistic methods to address many decision-making scenarios involving humans and AI.  Our work spans specific application domains (health and wellness) as well as broader socio-technical questions around human-AI interaction, AI accountability, and responsible and effective AI regulation. Our work falls into three major areas:

1. **Probabilistic modeling and inference**: <br>
  *We focus especially on Bayesian models*
    - How can we characterize the uncertainty in large, heterogeneous data?
    - How can we fit models that will be useful for downstream decision-making?
    - How can we build models and inference techniques that will behave in expected and desired ways?
2. **Decision-making under uncertainty**: <br>
  *We focus especially on sequential decision-making*
    - How can we optimize policies given batches of heterogeneous data?
    - How can we provide useful information, even if we can't solve for a policy?
    - How can we characterize the limits of our ability to provide decision support?
3. **Interpretability and statistical methods for validation**:
    - How can we estimate the quality of a policy from batch data?
    - How can we expose key elements of a model or policy for expert inspection?
