## What is the purpose of InTouch Coffee Hours?

Our coffee chats are for building community across all of SEAS, and in this sense they're similar to department or lab happy hours, except that you'll meet students from all across SEAS. We also host coffee chats as a dedicated place where you can seek advice on life as a graduate student. For exampe, G1s ask about what is a reasonable course load, G4s ask senior graduate students about how to talk about graduating with their advisors, etc. Sometimes we talk about how to survive surfing in below freezing tempratures. It's a place for identifying, normalizing, and helping each other through the ups **and** the downs of life as a graduate student.


## How does InTouch interact with other support services within SEAS?


## Is my problem too small, too big, or too ambiguous to bring to InTouch? 

No! We are happy to talk about anything that's on your mind, regardless of how "big" or "small" it may be. Especially if you have a concern that you don't know who to reach out to, you are welcome to start with us. We're here to listen, provide advice when it is welcome, and point you to resources across Harvard that you may find helpful. 

## What do InTouch peers offer that I can't get from other people or organizations?
