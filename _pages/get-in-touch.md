InTouch Peers are purposfully spread throughout the departments and buildings of SEAS, and encourage you to start up a casual conversation.
Feel free to say hello and introduce yourself any time (you never need a reason).
In particular, feel free to email any one of us [peers]({{site.url}}/peers),
and join our regular bi-weekly coffee after lunch.
