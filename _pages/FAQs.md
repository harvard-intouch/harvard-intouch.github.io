## What is the purpose of InTouch Coffee Hours?

Coffee chats are for building community across all of SEAS, and in this sense they're similar to dept or lab happy hours, except you'll meet people all across SEAS. We also host coffee chats as a dedicated place where you can seek advice on life as a grad student. G1s ask about what is a reasonable course load. G4s ask senior grad students about how to talk about graduating with their advisors. Sometimes we talk about how to survive surfing in below freezing temps. It's a place for identifying, normalizing, and helping each other through the ups AND the downs of life as a graduate student.


## How does InTouch interact with other support services within SEAS?

## Is my problem too small, too big, too ambiguous to bring to InTouch? 

## What do InTouch peers offer that I can't get from other people or organizations?
