        Hello! I am Larissa Zhou. I am a G4 in Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, advised by Prof. Dave Weitz. I work on quantifying food texture and building devices for cooking in space. I worked as a food scientist for 7 years between undergrad and grad school. I am happy to talk about adjusting to grad school after being out of academia for a while, burnout, the Harvard bubble, working alone, finding mentors, feeling stupid, figuring out who you want to be when you grow up...I love to climb and to eat Chinese food.

        Hi! My name is Drew, and I am a G3 in Environmental Engineering advised by Daniel Jacob. In my research, I use atmospheric models and machine learning to study air quality and estimate pollutant emissions. Outside of research, I'm a steward in the graduate student union, which means I connect SEAS students with resources and help enforce our contract, which we won together in 2021. In my spare time I run (badly), climb (even more badly), and read.

        Hello! I came to Harvard for grad school in Physics and somehow never left. After working with SEAS TFs at the Bok Center I happily moved over to SEAS; my role is to support our grad students both academically and whole-life-wise, in collaborating with colleagues in GSAS. Contact me whenever it would help, or drop by the Office of Academic Programs to meet all our staff!
