      blurb: |-
        I work on uncertainty quantification and tractable approximate inference for deep Bayesian latent variable models, with applications in health-care. Before joining DtAK, I earned my Masters in Music in Contemporary Improvisation from the New England Conservatory in 2016 and my AB in Computer Science from Harvard College in 2015.
