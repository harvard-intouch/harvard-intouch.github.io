        Hi, my name is John Ahrens and I work in the Jennifer Lewis lab. Reach out to me anytime. I often talk with students about work-life balance, setting expectations for your work, how to get/stay organized, advisor relationships, outdoor activities throughout New England (surfing, hiking, camping, basketball).

        Hello! I am Larissa Zhou. I am a G4 in Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, advised by Prof. Dave Weitz. I work on quantifying food texture and building devices for cooking in space. I worked as a food scientist for 7 years between undergrad and grad school. I am happy to talk about adjusting to grad school after being out of academia for a while, burnout, the Harvard bubble, working alone, finding mentors, feeling stupid, figuring out who you want to be when you grow up...I love to climb and to eat Chinese food.

        Hello! I came to Harvard for grad school in Physics and somehow never left. After working with SEAS TFs at the Bok Center I happily moved over to SEAS; my role is to support our grad students both academically and whole-life-wise, in collaborating with colleagues in GSAS. Contact me whenever it would help, or drop by the Office of Academic Programs to meet all our staff!
